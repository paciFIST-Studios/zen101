    <h1>The First Principle</h1>
    <p>When one goes to Obaku temple in Kyoto one sees carved over the gate the words &#8220;The First principle&#8221;. The letters are unusually large, and those who appreciate calligraphy always admire them as being a masterpiece. They were drawn by Kosen two hundred years ago.</p>
    <p>When the master drew them he did so on paper, from which workmen made the larger carving in wood. As Kosen sketched the letters a bold pupil was with him who had made several gallons of ink for the calligraphy and who never failed to criticize his master&#8217;s work.</p>
    <p>That is not good,&#8221; he told Kosen after the first effort.</p>
    <p>&#8220;How is that one?&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Poor. Worse than before,&#8221; pronounced the pupil.</p>
    <p>Kosen patiently wrote one sheet after another until eighty-four First Principles had accumulated, still without the approval of the pupil.</p>
    <p>Then, when the young man stepped outside for a few moments, Kosen thought: &#8220;Now is my chance to escape his keen eye,&#8221; and he wrote hurriedly, with a mind free from distraction: &#8220;The First principle.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;A masterpiece,&#8221; pronounced the pupil.</p>
